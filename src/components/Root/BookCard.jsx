    review:
      "'The Great Gatsby' by F. Scott Fitzgerald is a timeless masterpiece that delves into the decadence and disillusionment of the Jazz Age. Set in the Roaring Twenties, the novel unveils the enigmatic Jay Gatsby's extravagant parties, masking a pursuit of lost love. Narrated by Nick Carraway, the story explores themes of wealth, love, and the American Dream, drawing readers into a vivid portrayal of the glittering yet elusive world of the East and West Egg. Fitzgerald's prose is both poetic and haunting, weaving a compelling narrative that transcends its era. A poignant exploration of societal excess and the human condition, 'The Great Gatsby' remains a literary gem that resonates across generations.",
